# ATI-Radeon-5450-DSDT-Injection
DSDT injection for ATI 5450.

So here are some dsl files Iâ€™ve made for ATY injection. These edits
come up P0P1, PEG0, PEGP.

Injecting ATY is the most efficient way to inject Device IDs to Apple
Stock kexts without editing kext. When applying a update to OS X you
will still have QE/CI/ OpenGL natively.
