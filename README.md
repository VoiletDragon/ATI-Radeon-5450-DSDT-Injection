# ATI-Radeon-5450-DSDT-Injection
DSDT injection for ATI 5450.

So here are some dsl files Iâ€™ve made for ATY injection. These edits
come up P0P1, PEG0, PEGP. 

So ony add this edit under P0P1, PEG0, PEGP in youre DSDT.

Recommend adding these edits to a clean DSDT freshly from ACPI by pressing F4 at Clover. Clean DSDT goes in EFI/Clover/ACPI/orgin.

Injecting ATY is the most efficient way to inject Device IDs to Apple
Stock kexts without editing kext. When applying a update to OS X you
will still have QE/CI/ OpenGL natively.
